## 📖 Overview

**Puzzle Creator** is an interactive web dashboard for designing and analyzing level difficulty in *My Little Bookstore*, a hexasort puzzle + bookstore management mobile game developed at **SKKU Game Center Lab** in collaboration with NYU under the RISE program.

### What is Hexasort?

Hexasort is a mobile puzzle genre where players sort colored chips stacked on hexagonal tiles by matching colors. Difficulty is determined by two components:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Board Layout** | Tile count, stack positions, locked tiles, gimmick placement |
| **Gameplay Parameters** | Allocation target, color pool, duplication rate, unlock timing |

### Why was this built?

| Problem | Previous Approach | Puzzle Creator |
|---|---|---|
| Generate 500 levels | Manual PowerPoint work per level | Auto-generation via difficulty formula |
| No objective difficulty standard | Subjective designer judgment | Real-world market data analysis |
| Can't preview board layouts | Open JSON files manually | Interactive hex grid visualization |
| Hard to tune difficulty weights | Edit code & re-run | Real-time slider adjustment |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
① Market Data Analysis
   market_lv1_100.csv  ←  SKKU Game Center Lab (real-world Lv 1~100 data)
         ↓  Extract H1-1~H1-15 indicators + weighted sum
   board_score  →  Derive difficulty curve pattern
         ↓
   target(N) = (70 − 52 × e^(−N/90)) + 3.71 + local_var[(N−1) mod 100]

② Automated Level Generation  (generate_levels.py)
   target(N) as difficulty goal
         ↓  Retry board generation (max 10 attempts)
   board_score ≈ target(N)
         ↓
   stack_score_target = target(N) × 2 − board_score  →  tblStage params
         ↓
   Integrated Difficulty = (board_score + stack_score) / 2  ≈  target(N)

③ Visualization & Validation  (this app)
   JSON + tblStage  →  Curve comparison / Board preview / Regeneration
```

## 📊 Real-World Data

The difficulty curve is derived from **real gameplay data** collected by the SKKU Game Center Lab:

- **Source**: Top-ranked hexasort puzzle game on the Korean mobile market
- **Coverage**: Levels 1–100, manually played and recorded
- **Metrics**: 15 board-level indicators (H1-1 ~ H1-15)
  - Grid count, stack positions, open-side sums, lock counts, gimmick ratios, color complexity, etc.
- **Limitation**: In-game stack parameters (tblStage equivalent) were not collectible from competitor titles → gameplay weights are heuristic-based, pending validation with post-launch play data

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahyeong0202/My-Little-Bookstore_Puzzle-Creator.git
cd My-Little-Bookstore_Puzzle-Creator
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Updating Level JSONs

**Method A — Via App (Recommended)**
1. Open `🎲 4. JSON Generator` tab
2. Select level range with slider
3. Click **Generate** → watch real-time difficulty display
4. Download ZIP → upload to `data/levels/` on GitHub

**Method B — Direct Script**
```python
import json, pandas as pd
from generate_levels import generate_level, target_diff

df = pd.read_excel('data/tblStage_500.xlsx', sheet_name='Stage')
df_n = df[df['LevelName'].str.startswith('N ', na=False)].reset_index(drop=True)

for lv in range(1, 501):
    level_data, stack_params, bs, ss, intg = generate_level(lv, df_n.iloc[lv-1])
    with open(f'data/levels/N_{lv:03d}.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(level_data, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)
```

## 📐 Difficulty Formula

```
target(N) = (70 − 52 × e^(−N/90)) + 3.71 + local_var[(N−1) mod 100]
```

- **Base curve**: Exponential convergence — Lv1 ≈ 18pt → Lv100 ≈ 48pt → ~74pt ceiling
- **local_var**: 100-value oscillation pattern extracted from market data (repeats every 100 levels)
- **Integrated difficulty**: `board_score × w% + gameplay_score × (100-w)%` ≈ `target(N)`

---

## 🔄 Iteration Plan

```
Current: Market data-based design (heuristic gameplay weights)
       ↓
Post-launch: Collect real play data (clear rate, attempt count)
       ↓
Validate & correct difficulty weights objectively
       ↓
Regenerate 500+ levels with improved curve
```
